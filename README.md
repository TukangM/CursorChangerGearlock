# CursorChangerGearlock
A cursor changer for android x86, powered by gearlock bash. The initial project began as a boot animation pack, which i later separated into cursor and boot animations.
Aim of the program is to, allow fast swapping between cursors , dynamically patch the system framework, allowing the change of cursor on any Android x86 distro with gearlock installed. This is written in pure bash, so it is portable and versatile, and fast as well.\
